**iPhone Weather App Clone**

During my time at App Academy Berlin, we were tasked with integrating a simple weather API into a Flutter project. I decided to challenge myself by recreating the iPhone Weather App.

**Features**

- The app dynamically changes the theme and background based on the current weather conditions.
- Simple and intuitive design inspired by the iPhone Weather App.

**Limitations**

This was a small project with limited time, so not all features could be completed (e.g., detailed data display on the home screen).

**Screenshots**

Below are six images showcasing the app in action.
